The `first two phases` refer to the `exercises inside the Master notebooks` of the [DM2025-Lab2-Exercise Repo](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise.git). The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",

    "- **Phase 2 exercises:** We use Gemini's API so everything can be run with only CPU without a problem.\n",
    "- **Phase 3 exercises:** For the competition you will probably need GPU to train your models, so it is recommended to use Colab or Kaggle if you don't have a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n",

    "The preprocessing stage began with importing the necessary libraries, navigating to the correct workign directory, and loading the datasets. Since the final_posts file was provided in JSON format, some additional handling was required because the post_id and associated text of interest were contained within a nested structure. This was implemented by expanding the corresponding JSON level and normalising it into a dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the datasets, the structure and column names were checked before merging these into a single comprehensive dataframe containing all text data and the corresponding emotion labels and ids. The training data was then shuffled to avoid any bias associated with the original ordering prior to moving on to feature engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, a brief exploratory data analysis was conducted, which included generating counts for each emotion class and plotting a visualisation of this distribution. Here, it was clear that joy was disproportionately represented, which raised early concerns about potential model overfitting towards the majority class. \n",

    "### 1.2 Feature Engineering Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Several feature engineering approaches were experimented with including Bag of Words, a reduced BOW with a 500-word vocabulary, and variations with and without removing stop words. These approaches were found to perform more poorly during validation and were ultimately determined to be less suitable for capturing subtle emotional cues from text.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this process, TF-IDF was found to be the most effective method, given it helped provide varying weights to common vs unique words and enabled the identification of bigrams that may otherwise be difficult for the final model to interpret such as \"not good\" or \"super bad\".\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, a lemmatizer function was defined using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer library to enhance the model's ability to generalise words by consolidating those words that were semantically similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through a series of trial and eror, the hyperparameters for the TF-IDF vectorizer such as n-gram range, vocab size, and min/max document freeuqncy were determined by observing how these affected the resulting validation performanc metrics. Once this was finalsised, the TF-IDF vectoriser was fit on the training data and used to transform both validation and testing sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Explanation of Your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Several models were initially evaluated including decision trees, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and linear SVM. The final model was implemented using LienarSVC - or Support Vector Machine classifier, given it consistently achieved the best performance when applied to a validation set. This validation split of 80/20 was created using the 'train_test_split' function from the sklearn.model_selection library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through some experiment with different hyperparameters, the best performing Linear SVC model was found using the regularisation parameter C = 0.24. Once the resulting validation performance was determined to be satisfactory, the previously fitted TF-IDF vectoriser was finally applied to the test set, and predictions were trained with the trained model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final predictions were reformatted to ensure these met the submission requirements (i.e. checking that column labels and content are correct) before exporting as a CSV. \n",

    "\n",
    "At the feature engineering stage, several variations were trialled: \n",
    "- Bag-of-words\n",
    "- Reuced BOW (BOW_500)\n",
    "- Removing stop words\n",
    "- Alternative n-gram ranges (e.g. only unigrams, bigrams)\n",

    "### 2.2 Mention Insights You Gained\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of trial and error revealed several interesting insights: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Stop words may be valuable in providing emotional context:**\n",
    "* Model performance actually improved when stop words were preserved within the text. Though this was initially surprising, it was later recognised that some phrases expressing emotion can rely on stop words to convey emotion. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bigrams convey more emotions than unigrams:**\n",
    "* Similar as above, bigrams helped the model detect subtle patterns and some contradictory phrases (like \"not happy\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemmatization improved generalisation more than expected:**\n",
    "* Reducing words to their base form reduced redundancy and was found to strengthen the model's ability to recognise similar expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF worked well at classifying emotions:**\n",
    "* It was found to outperform the other feature engineering models by providign a good balance between capturing key terms while reduging noise from overly frequent words, making it ideal for this context. \n",
